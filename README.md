This project is based on the end-of-section projects from the tutorial ASP.NET Core True Ultimate Guide Real, linked below. I am still actively working on this project and 
updating the code at the end of each section.The purpose of this project is to fetch stock prices from https://finnhub.io, display them, and allow users to add buy-sell 
orders for the stocks. My primary goal is not to showcase the best front-end design but to demonstrate an excellent back-end implementation.Additionally, the aim of this project 
is to learn the key aspects of ASP.NET Core and back-end development.
